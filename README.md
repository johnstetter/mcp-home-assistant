# MCP Home Assistant Server & Client

...

Let me know if you'd like:
- A ZIP archive download
- A push directly to your GitHub repo (`git@github.com:johnstetter/mcp-home-assistant.git`)
- A walkthrough of any specific part (e.g., adding WebSocket support or OpenAPI spec for GPT tool calling)

Ready when you are, boss.
